HTML Advanced Project

In this project, the goal is to build the semantic HTML structure of a webpage from a Figma design file. I will be focusing only on the HTML, meaning no CSS or styling will be applied in this stage. The purpose of this project is to emphasize clean, well-organized, and accessible HTML.
